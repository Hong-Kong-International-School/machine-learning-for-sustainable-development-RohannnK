<-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

In this project, I will address SDG number 2: Zero Hunger. Right now, there are 828 million people who go to sleep on an empty stomach every night. Even more shocking, around 2.3 billion people face some level of food insecurity on a daily basis. This is all despite the fact that there is more than enough food for everyone. This is due to a wide variety of reasons, but one of them is crop disease. An estimated 14.1% of all crops grown for human consumption perish annualy as a result of crop disease. A lot of the time, crops succumb to disease due to farmers not being able to identify which crops are suffering from what disease. Thus, in order to help combat this, this app, powered by a neural network based on Resnet, can identify 38 different types of plant/crop disease simply by taking a photo of the plant.

<-- HOW TO USE-->

### Step 1: Download the Project

### Step 2: Run the Xcode project files in Xcode
Make sure your Xcode version is updated enough to run/utilise neural networks

### Step 3: Connect an Apple Device and Grant Permissions
Connect an iPhone or iPad to your computer via USB cable. This may depend on the version of Xcode you have and your iOS version. You also may need to grant permissions on your phone and computer.

### Step 4: Run the Project
Press the run button and wait for the app to launch on your connected device. Once launched, click the "Take Photo" button to take a photo of the plant and the app will classify what disease it has.
